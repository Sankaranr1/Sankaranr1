- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sankaranr1. I am a PhD candidate in physics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore
- 👀 I’m interested in ultrafast spectroscopy, right now I am working on Two-dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy (2DES). This is a technique to study the physics of materials using very short pulses of light
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build codes in python to help analyze raw 2DES data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a GUI in Python to analyze 2DES data in real time. 
- 📫 How to reach me : you can email me @ sankaranramesh17@gmail.com
